# Financial Report Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the Financial Report Dashboard project! As a self-learner exploring data visualization with Dash, this is my first dashboard project. The goal is to present financial insights in a user-friendly and interactive way using Dash, Plotly Express, and Pandas.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

1. `file.py`: Contains the `Reports` class responsible for extracting financial insights from an Excel file.

2. `dashboard.py`: The main Dash application file, where the `Reports` class is used to display financial data interactively.

## Usage

To run the dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-report-dashboard.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ``` bash
   cd finacial_dashbord
3. Install the required dependencies
   ``` bash
   pip install dash pandas plotly
4. Run the dashboard
   ``` bash
   python dashboard.py
